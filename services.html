            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>If you have a new problem or injury that is causing you pain or dysfunction, book a 60-minute initial consultation so that we can discuss the history of the problem in detail and accurately assess what might be the cause. We may use hands on assessment of mobility and strength, or a performance-based screening in the gym. If indicated, we also have the ability to refer directly for diagnostic imaging such as X-ray, MRI and Ultrasound scans either privately, or via your GP.
            </p>
            <p>If you are new to PAWB Physiotherapy or are returning with a different concern, please click <a href="https://pawb-physiotherapy.uk2.cliniko.com/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to book an initial consultation.

            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>We will work with you to create a bespoke treatment plan that will include the most effective options available to you. This may include hands-on therapy such as massage or acupuncture to improve your pain, lifestyle changes and advice, or a programme of exercises to target any areas lacking mobility or strength. If onward referral is needed, we will recommend for you to see one of our trusted partners, or one of the Specialist Consultants that we work closely with in South Wales.
            </p>
            <p>At PAWB, in order to make it as easy as possible for you to stick to your exercise programme, we use a software called PhysiTrack. This includes pictures, videos and written explanations of all your exercises, and you can access it via an app on your phone or tablet, or via email.
            </p>
            <p>For a follow up appointment to look at progress, for ongoing hands on treatment, or to discuss the next steps in your rehab journey, you will need to book a Follow Up Appointment by clicking <a href="https://pawb-physiotherapy.uk2.cliniko.com/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

            <h2>Performance Rehabilitation</h2>
            <p>At PAWB, we have a wealth of experience working with elite athletes in a wide range of sports, so for those wanting to return to the sport or activity that they love, we don’t just stop at making you pain free. We understand that returning to normal daily activities with no pain is very different to returning to a sporting activity due to the high demands placed on your body. We will help you to recover fully from your injury, prepare your body for those increased demands, and aim to get you back performing at the level you want as soon as possible. There is lots of evidence to shows that the biggest risk factor for future injury is previous injury. As a result of this, we will also provide an ongoing plan to help reduce this risk.
            </p>
            <p>We offer gym-based rehabilitation, running assessments, and return to sport pitch sessions.
            </p>  
            <p>For any gym-based or performance rehabilitation sessions book a Follow Up appointment <a href="https://pawb-physiotherapy.uk2.cliniko.com/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>If you are already progressing well through your rehab and have been advised to book a pitch rehab session, click <a href="https://pawb-physiotherapy.uk2.cliniko.com/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

            <h2>Post-Operative Physiotherapy</h2>
                <p>If you have recently had an orthopaedic operation and want extra support to help you recover as quickly as possible, then PAWB physiotherapy is the place for you. We have extensive knowledge and experience on post-operative treatment, and understand the best ways to regain full function after your surgery.
                </p>
                <p>Each patient is different, and their recovery goals will vary. Your goal may be to return to gardening following a hip replacement, or to return to international sport following an ACL reconstruction. PAWB physiotherapy will guide you through the process, working with your Consultant to ensure that you meet those goals and get the best possible outcome following your surgery.
                </p>
                <p>Your operation may have involved foot and ankle surgery, knee ligament repairs, knee or hip replacements and arthroscopies, spinal surgery, or shoulder surgery.
                </p>
                <p>We accept referrals from private consultants, and can also supplement any NHS physiotherapy you may already be having.
                </p>
                <p>Book in for an Initial Consultation <a href="https://pawb-physiotherapy.uk2.cliniko.com/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, or contact us <a href="index.html#contact-us">here</a> with any questions about your operation to see if this may be suitable for you.

<div class="services_page__divider">
    <p>Can't get to us in person? We offer a variety of options such as video consultations and home visits.</p>
</div>

    <section class="services_page" id="video">
        <div class="services_page__text">
            <h2>Video Consultations</h2>
            <p>We understand that it’s not always possible to travel due to transport issues or time constraints, but we believe this shouldn’t mean you are unable to access the best care. Our video consultations are the perfect solution to this – we can discuss your concern, whether that be post-operative rehabilitation or a second opinion on a pre-existing injury.
            </p>
            <p>Our video consultations are 30 minutes long, and you will receive a bespoke programme to follow in a similar manner to face-to-face follow ups. If you feel you may need longer than 30 minutes this can be discussed directly with us.
            </p>
            <p>Click <a href="https://pawb-physiotherapy.uk2.cliniko.com/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, to book a Video Consultation, or contact us <a href="index.html#contact-us">here</a> for any other enquiries.

        <div class="services_page__text">
            <h2>Home Visits</h2>
            <p>Home visits can often be the most effective way of assessing you in your own environment, and working on day to day tasks such as mobility issues or reducing falls risk in the elderly. They can also be a good way of getting a head start with your post-operative rehabilitation where you aren’t able to drive yet, or including sports massage or hands on physiotherapy treatment into your busy schedule.
            </p>   
            <p>Home visits are available within the wider Cardiff area. Contact us <a href="index.html#contact-us">here</a> to enquire about availability, and whether this may be suitable for you.
