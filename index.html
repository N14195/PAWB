  <div class="testimonial__text testimonial__text--0"><p><span class="quotes">“</span>5*! Jonny was recommended to me for a last-minute foot injury, which happened 3 weeks before the London Marathon in October 2022! I had a handful of sessions with Jonny in the 3 week taper window and I will forever be grateful to him as he certainly got me through the day with his extensive treatment, knowledge and guidance. I have no doubt I would’ve caused myself further damage had I just left it to rest and then continued to run on it. I got through race day with an epic PB and continue to be injury free. I would HIGHLY recommend him and will definitely be seeing him again in the future for some running pre-hab/injury prevention sessions. Thanks again!<span class="quotes">”</span><br>

He helped identify the problem and has given me some great exercises to manage it and prevent it from happening again! Really recommend!<span class="quotes">”</span><br>

  <div class="testimonial__text testimonial__text--2"><p><span class="quotes">“</span>I am exceedingly grateful for what Jonny has done for me. Running means a huge amount to me and this was recognised in his approach to my treatment. I cannot recommend his services enough, and I have no doubt that he can cope with any type of issue brought to his attention. It is a professional relationship that I have no intention of ending as long as I am engaged in sport of any kind.<span class="quotes">”</span><br>

  <div class="testimonial__text testimonial__text--3"><p><span class="quotes">“</span>Jonny was my physio after a knee arthroscopy operation to repair a torn meniscus. It was inspiring to see a dedicated professional who is both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his area of expertise being so supportive, and wanting me to do well under his guidance. I never felt rushed into achieving a goal ahead of schedule as Jonny was mindful of recovery times. Thanks to Jonny (and the surgeon), my life is getting back to normal.<span class="quotes">”</span><br>
